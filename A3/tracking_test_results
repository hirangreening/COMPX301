A. a (PASSED)
B. ab (PASSED)
C. aa*b (PASSED) - Fixed handling of '*' by improving handlestar and getlaststate methods.
D. a?b (PASSED) - Corrected '?' logic in handleQuestion and ensured patching uses patchToJoin.
E. a.a (PASSED)
F. a.*b (PASSED)
G. a\.b (PASSED)
H. a\.*b (PASSED)
I. ab|cd (PASSED) - Fixed alternation by patching both branches to a join state, not the branch node.
J. a(b|c)d (PASSED) - Ensured parseTerm uses patchToJoin for chaining, not linkStates/getLastState.
K. a(b\|c)d (PASSED)
L. a(b|c)(de|fg)a (PASSED)
M. ab*b?a (PASSED)
N. g(a(b|c)a)|(de)g (PASSED)
O. (bb|cc)?d*e\.\?\*\)|\(\)aa (PASSED)
P. a(dd|ee)?a(gg|ff)*a (PASSED)
Notes: 
- Major fixes included using patchToJoin for all chaining in parseTerm, 
- Recursively patching all dangling transitions in alternation and optionals,
- Avoiding patching the branch node itself in alternation,
- Ensuring repetition and optional operators correctly patch their subgraphs.
All tests now pass after these changes.
